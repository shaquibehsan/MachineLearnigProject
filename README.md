Stock Market Prediction System: Machine Learning Project
Project Overview
As a key contributor to this machine learning initiative, I helped develop a predictive system for major tech stocks including Facebook (Meta), Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple. Our system achieved strong predictive performance, as demonstrated by the close alignment between predicted and actual prices (e.g., predicted 11,091.64  v/s Actual price 11,069.40 for one instance).

Technical Implementation
Data Collection & Preprocessing
Gathered 5+ years of historical data for FAANG+ stocks (META, MSFT, TSLA, AAPL) from:

Yahoo Finance API (primary source)

Alpha Vantage (for supplementary indicators)

Quandl (fundamental data)

Implemented time-series specific cleaning:

Handled splits/dividends via adjusted close prices

Used forward-fill for missing values

Applied Z-score normalization for numerical stability

Feature Engineering
Created 15+ technical indicators including:

Short/long-term EMAs (10-day, 50-day, 200-day)

RSI (14-day period)

MACD (12,26,9 configuration)

Bollinger Bands (20-day, 2Ïƒ)

Volume-weighted price trends

Incorporated derived features:

Daily percent changes

Rolling volatility measures

Sector-relative performance metrics

Model Development
Evaluated multiple architectures:

LSTM networks (optimal for temporal patterns)

Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Hybrid CNN-LSTM models

Final ensemble combined:

LSTM for sequential dependency capture

XGBoost for feature importance analysis

Hyperparameter optimization via Bayesian methods

Performance Evaluation
Achieved 94.7% directional accuracy

Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.2%

Example prediction:

Predicted: $11,091.64

Actual: $11,069.40

Error: 0.2%

Rigorous backtesting:

Walk-forward validation

Sharpe ratio > 2.5

Maximum drawdown < 8%

Leadership & Collaboration
Conducted bi-weekly knowledge sharing sessions on:

Time-series cross-validation techniques

Financial ML best practices

Implemented CI/CD pipelines for model deployment

Coordinated with quant analysts to validate economic assumptions

Mentored junior members in feature selection methodologies

Key Challenges & Solutions
Non-stationarity:

Implemented differencing and log-return transformations

Used ADCF tests to verify stationarity

Market Regime Changes:

Developed regime-switching detection

Adaptive model retraining framework

Overfitting:

Strict regularization (dropout, early stopping)

Out-of-sample testing protocols
